# count

=begin
The Enumerable#count method iterates over the members of a collection, passing
each element to the associated block. It then returns the number of elements for 
which the block returns a truthy value.

Write a method called count that behaves similarly for an arbitrarily long list
of arguments. It should take 0 or more arguments and a block, and then return 
the total number of arguments for which the block returns true.

If the argument list is empty, count should return 0.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #reduce, loop, 
for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but
must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other 
collection.
