# Test word_count method - Text

=begin
Recall that in the last exercise we only had to test one method of our Text
class. One of the useful facets of the setup and teardown methods is that they
are automatically run before and after each test respectively. To show this 
we'll be adding one more method to our Text class, word_count.
=end

class Text
  def initialize(text)
    @text = text
  end

  def swap(letter_one, letter_two)
    @text.gsub(letter_one, letter_two)
  end

  def word_count
    @text.split.count
  end
end

=begin
Write a test for this new method. Make sure to utilize the setup and teardown 
methods for any file related operations.
