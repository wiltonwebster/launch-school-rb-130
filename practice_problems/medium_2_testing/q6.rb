# Test Prompt For Payment Method- Transaction

=begin
Write a test that verifies that Transaction#prompt_for_payment sets the
amount_paid correctly. We've changed the transaction class a bit to make testing 
this a bit easier. The Transaction#prompt_for_payment now reads as:
=end

def prompt_for_payment(input: $stdin)
  loop do
    puts "You owe $#{item_cost}.\nHow much are you paying?"
    @amount_paid = input.gets.chomp.to_f # notice that we call gets on that parameter
    break if valid_payment? && sufficient_payment?
    puts 'That is not the correct amount. ' \
         'Please make sure to pay the full cost.'
  end
end

=begin
We've added an input keyword parameter that lets the caller provide a different 
source of input. The default value for the parameter is $stdin; if we don't 
provide the input parameter, Ruby will use $stdin as its value.

What is $stdin? It represents the standard input stream, which is usually the 
keyboard. Specifically, $stdin is a global variable that Ruby uses to represent
the default source of input. Thus, when we write code such as str = gets.chomp,
it's equivalent to str = $stdin.gets.chomp.

If we don't need to specify $stdin, then why do we need to use it with this 
method? Couldn't we just call gets.chomp.to_f on line 4 above? We could, if we 
always wanted to get input from the keyboard. However, sometimes we need to get
input from elsewhere. In particular, when testing interactive programs, you 
don't want to sit at the keyboard and provide the same inputs over and over. It 
would be nice if we could "mock" the keyboard input - that is, send input to the
program in such a way that it can read it without changing any code. That's 
where code like this comes into play. We can call prompt_for_payment with an 
argument that provides the input in a way that is indistinguishable from
keyboard input.

In this exercise, we'll need to simulate -- mock -- the user input. Our tests
need to be automated, so we can't prompt the user with Kernel#gets. One way to 
do that is to pass a "string stream" to the method as the input parameter. Ruby
provides a string stream class called StringIO. To use it, all you need to do is
create a StringIO object that contains all of your simulated keyboard inputs, 
then pass it to prompt_for_payment. For instance:
=end

input = StringIO.new("30\n")
transaction.prompt_for_payment(input: input)

=begin
The object assigned to input here is a StringIO object that simulates the
keyboard by acting like the user typed the number 30, then pressed the Return
key (\n). Check out how this works with gets:
=end

input = StringIO.new("30\n")
number = input.gets.chomp
puts "The number was #{number}!"   # prints "The number was 30!"

=begin
With this technique, running tests for keyboard entry is a breeze. Just sit back
and watch things run. Writing the tests is a little harder. Once you understand 
how a StringIO object works, though, and you modify your code for the additional
flexibility, it's not too hard.

The key to solving this exercise lies with this technique. We'll be testing a 
method defined in the Transaction class. It may be best to include this test in
a new test file related to the Transaction class.
