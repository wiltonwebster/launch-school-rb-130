# Alter Prompt For Payment Method - Transaction

=begin
You may have noticed something when running the test for the previous exercise. 
And that is that our minitest output wasn't that clean. We have some residual
output from the Transaction#prompt_for_payment method.

Transaction#prompt_for_payment has a call to Kernel#puts and that output is 
showing up when we run our test. Your task for this exercise is to make it so 
that we have "clean" output when running this test.
