# Test swap method - Text

=begin
For this exercise you'll be given a sample text file and a starter class. The
sample text's contents will be saved as a String to an instance variable in the 
starter class.

The Text class includes a #swap method that can be used to replace all 
occurrences of one letter in the text with another letter. And for this exercise
we will swap all occurrences of 'a' with 'e'.

Your task is to write a test suite for class Text. In that test suite write a 
test for the Text method swap. For this exercise, you are required to use the 
minitest methods #setup and #teardown. The #setup method contains code that will
be executed before each test; #teardown contains code that will be executed 
after each test.
